                    <h2>About Us</h2>
    
                    <p>DIGI-ARTS-KE was formed in 2022 by Dev-Knights & CO. We all love art and it forms Parts of our lives ,in our thoughts and sometimes in our actions . Everything has a form of artistic expression to it be it as simple as the devices we use to even the houses we live in. Art is around us and we love to surround ourselves in it .</p>
                    
                    <p> We have numerous Artists who lack an avenue to get their artistic work the deserved exposure . Artists are some of the most dedicated and inspirational people we have around but some of them are discouraged and resort to other forms of ‘hustling’ to make ends meet rather than utilize their talents.</p>
                    
                    <p> We aim at creating an avenue to give this recognition to notable people and the works they have made by also making it possible for them to also attend events where they can  .</p>
