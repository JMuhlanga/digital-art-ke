## Introduction

We all love art and it forms Parts of our lives ,in our thoughts and sometimes in our actions . Everything has a form of artistic expression to it be it as simple as the devices we use  to even the houses we live in. Art is around us  and we love to surround ourselves in it .

## Problem Statement 

We have numerous Artists who lack an avenue to get their artistic work the deserved exposure . Artists are some of the most dedicated and inspirational people we have around  but some of them are discouraged and resort to other forms of ‘hustling’ to make ends meet rather than utilize their talents.

At the same time, most of the lay man do not know where to go to get art. Art can liven up the mood as well as enhance ones decoration in the house. Art can also be used as a means to convey a message embedded within itself. When the ‘lay’ people mostly think of art , they might think that its expensive to get , while also being hard to know where to get it from. 

Artistry and art can also be an economic activity. Not  only just by making , marketing and selling it but by also trading it as a commodity like the stock market. This is an up an coming means of investment, whereby a collective put an amount of money into an art piece which is then traded on the open market   bringing back good Money.
